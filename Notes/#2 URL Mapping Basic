Going into settings.py found in the project folder, the practice case first_project

There is a list called INSTALLED_APPS =[...] --> in this list we add our application: first_app

so it'll look like INSTALLED_APPS[
'django. etc',
'django. etc',
.            ,
.            ,
'first_app'
]

***            ***

Now we go to views.py

it says right at the top:
from django.shortcuts import render
**WE ADD : **
from django.http import HttpResponse

now we add the following function:

def index(request):
  return HttpResponse("Hello World!")

********* each view in this application is going to exist within that views.py file as its own individual function
          In this instance we just created ONE view called INDEX with that index function

******** each view is going to take in AT LEAST -- ONE ARGUMENT --
And for that HTTP request object, since it lives inside that Django HTTP module. By CONVENTION
we call the argument request -- referencing line 24 -- BUT AGAIN YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT ---> DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU CALL IT

******** each view must return an HttpResponse object --> in this example it's returning "Hello World!" -- line 25



So in summation
1) go to settings.py and add the new app we created --> practice version first_app
2) go to views.py add the necessary libraries then create the index function and pass http response
3) go to urls.py add the views.py file from the correct app folder i.e from first_app import views
4) while in the urls.py file go to urlspattern dictionary and add url(r'^$',views.index,name='index')
5) Bam we have officially connected the app

******** this is called url mapping AND THIS IS **ONE** WAY of doing url mapping
