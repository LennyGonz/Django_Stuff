Django operates on what is known as: Models-Templates-Views (MTV)

MTV encompasses the idea of how to connect: models-templates-views

There are basic steps to achieve the goal of serving dynamic content to a user based off the connection of the MTV


1) In the views.py file we import any models we will need to use

2) Use the view to query the model for data that we will need

3) Pass reults from the model to the template

4) Edit the template so that it is ready to accept and display the data from the model

5) Map a URL to the view.

We can practice this methodology by changing what we view on the index page

SO we're going to create a table, that will display all the webpages and access records from the AccessRecord database we created and populated

We will use template tagging to connect the model to the html page
