There are several ways of URL mappings

Method 1: This was a very direct mapping from the views.py to the urls.py

** NOW we're going to change it up by using the ***include()*** function from django.conf.urls
  ^
  The include function allows us to look for a match with regular expressions and linik back to our application's own urls.py file
  We have to manually add in this urls.py file because when we start our application it doesn't automatically create one for your

1) so when in the PROJECT'S urls.py file we go to libraries and add: from django.conf.urls import include
2) then in urlpatterns: [ ... url(r'^first_app/', include('first_app.urls')), ... ]
   ^
   this would allow us to look for any url that has the pattern: www.domainname.com/first_app/...

   If we match that pattern, the include() function basically tells django to go look at the urls.py file inside of first_app
   folder, not the urls.py file that's inside the project folder.

********* Why would we use this method? This is just a way to keep the PROJECT'S url.py file clean and modular instead of cluttered.
          Therefore we set the reference to the APP, instead of listing them all in the MAIN URLS


SO using first_app as practice

1) go to the project's urls.py and we need to activate the **include** library so we add: *from django.conf.urls import include*

2) then in urlpatterns we add: url(r'^first_app/',include('first_app.urls')),

** so we have linked them for now **

3) we go to the APPLICATION folder, in this case first_app, and create a new file and call it: urls.py

4) Then make it similar to the project's urls.py file and add 2 libraries:
from django.conf.urls import url
from first_app import views

5) then in urlpatterns we add: urlpatterns = [ url(r'^$',views.index,name='index'), ]

6) we run the server, everything should be working and to verify we go to the url and behind the backslash of c we type first_app
  ** we should still see "Hello, World!"

7) And just so we see how this works, if we go back to the project's url.py file
in this line: url(r'^first_app/',include('first_app.urls')), **if we change it to**
              url(r'^hello_world/',include('first_app.urls')),

then run the server again: http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello_world --> again we should still see "Hello World"
